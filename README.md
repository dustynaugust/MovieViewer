# MovieViewer
MovieViewer is a movies app displaying box office and top rental DVDs using [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3). Made for CodePath University weeks 1 and 2.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:
- [X] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [X] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [X] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [X] User can pull to refresh the movie list. <br><br>

- [X] User can view movie details by tapping on a cell.
- [X] User can select from a tab bar for either **Now Playing** or **Top Rated** movies.
- [X] Customize the selection effect of the cell.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
- [X] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [X] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [X] User can search for a movie.
- [X] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [X] Customize the UI.<br><br>
- [X] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete.
- [X] Customize the navigation bar.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
- [X] User may switch between collection view or table view.
- [X] Auto layout on all pages except the Details page. Scroll view and auto layout beat me here!
- [X] User may switch between TableView and CollectionView via a TabBarController.
- [X] Auto layout on all pages except the Details page. Scroll view and auto layout beat me here!
- [X] User may scroll infinitely. (Table view only right now)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I'd like to get an idea of how to clean up my code. Right now it seems like there is a lot too it and it is a bit messy.
2. Trying to get both collection and table views to implement together while maintaining the tab bar was very difficult
   and I didn't quite get it down. I'd like to see if that could actually be done and how.
